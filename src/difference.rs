//! A set of difference functions you can use with [SquasherBuilder::difference()]
//!
//! # Writing your own difference function
//! The type you want is `dyn Fn(&RGB8, &RGB8) -> f32`  
//! (defined as [`DiffFn`])
//!
//! The first argument is the color already in the palette and the second is
//! the color we're checking. These are [RGB8] which is a rexport from the `rgb`
//! crate.
//!
//! The value returned is between 0 and 768, but that's not a hard-rule. If you
//! return a value out of that range you'll have to adjust the tolerance with
//! [Squasher::set_tolerance()] or [SquasherBuilder::tolerance].
//!
//! The difference functions have the possibility of being called hundreds of
//! thousands of times; you might want to `#[inline(always)]`

// This is used in the module level documentation just above. Without it we'd
// have to fully qualify the interlink which is also how it'd be displayed.
